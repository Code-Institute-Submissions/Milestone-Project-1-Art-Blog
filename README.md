## Introduction

This is my submission for the first Milestone Project on the Code Institutes' Fullstack Web Developer course. 
The project is designed to showcase the skills I have gained in html, css & UX over the first quarter of the course.

Instead of using the example projects, I decided to run with my own project idea as explained below:

[The MtG Flavourist](https://jpmurdie.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-Art-Blog/) website is a fandom website based on breaking news about
the art, storyline and other developments of the collectable card game: Magic: The Gathering

Magic: The Gathering is a very visual paper & digital based collectable card game. Owned by Hasbro and created
by Wizards of the Coast, the game has made a very real push into the E-Sports market with the new release of
MtG: Arena. 

Magic: The Gathering is reknowned for its storylines and artwork and a netflix animation is currently in the works.


## Features

### Existing Features

* Image carousels on index and artist spotlight pages, copied from Bootstrap and edited to provided
    continued content on external pages. Restyled with customer CSS.
* Imbedded video on index html to allow viewers to watch a trailer without leaving my website.
* A navbar with two modal buttons, one containing a form, that blend into the rest of the nav. As well as a dropdown.
* Carousel content on artist spotlight pages shift from full art to card images based on page breaks.

### Suggested Next Features

* User Accounts.
* Comments enabled on all articles for user interaction.

## UX

The UX is designed to be highly visual but simple to use. This allows the website to serve
as a bridge between other content creators on other platforms as well and providing its
own disireable content and exclusive articles/interviews.

The UX mirrors throughout all pages for ease of use. This makes the website flow and ease to understand.

I aim to capture Magic's rich storylines, artwork and themes across my website via breaking news and artist spotlights.

## Website Details

### Deployment

I have deployed my website to Github Pages and it can be found here: [The MtG Flavourist](https://jpmurdie.github.io/Milestone-Project-1-Art-Blog/)

## Technologies

1. html
    * Used to create the core structure of all pages.
2. css
    * Used to create custom styles and override some Bootstrap classes where needed.
3. Google Fonts
    * Used to bring in a suitable font for my theme and style.
4. bootstrap (css)
    * Bootstraps grid system and feature documentation is heavily used throughout my website.
5. bootstrap (Javascript)
    * This is used for my image carousels and my Nav dropdown bar.
6. fontawesome icon library
    * Fontawesome is used for my social media links, for the index and spotlight pages as well
        as over-writing the carousel controls with Fontawesome's own arrow logos.
7. Browserling.com (Testing Platform)
    * Browsering was used alongside Chrome Dev tools to test my webpage across browswers and platforms.
8. Chrome Dev Tools
    * I would have been very lost without Chrome Dev Tools. The only time I had my website open without CDT
        is during final testing.
     

## Testing

Current, cross-platform, testing has been carried out on Chrome Dev Tools.
I've also used an Ipad and mobile device. to assess the layout correctly.

I've tested the website using Browserling also, to get a view of it across platforms and web browswers.

I tested my website from mobile breakpoints upwards, making sure it was fluid and looked perfect on mobile
before looking at larger breakpoints. This allowed me to build and test media queries within my style.css.

At first there were no structured notes within my code. I grew to find this incredibily difficult to maintain as the file grew.
I began to annotate the sections in block notes to make give clarity during my testing and also make my sections
clear to my mentor and reviewers.

I've repeatedly sent out links to my local MtG communitee and requested that they attempt to break the website, and let me know how they went about it.


## References

css code taken from StackOverflow - *jmore009* (noted in style.css)
* This piece of code still stills in my style.css file. I no longer reference it within
my html files, but it did teach me how to reference and remove display items with the bootstrap
grid more effectively. This allowed me to switch carousels via breakpoints in my spotlight pages.
For this reason I've left the code and username is as reference.
        
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* I copied and edited a vast amount of code from the bootstrap documentation
it allowed me to make sure that my nav, carousels and and other utilities formatted
well to the bootstrap grid system that I implemented.

## Thanks

Many thanks to my mentor, Reuben Ferrante, for his input and reviews of my code. His insight was straight forward
and extremely helpful in both code and design.

Thank you to the code institute mentors and the learning people for the check in calls throughout this module, it
made this part of the course feel well supported! :) 

Last but not least, thank you to the Slack communitee of students and graduates. I'm normally too far into my own bubble
to interact on Slack but I know you are all there supporting each other and that you would support me if I asked for help.
